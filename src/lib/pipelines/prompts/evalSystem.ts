Write ALL free-text feedback (summary, dimension rationales, strengths, improvements, constraintViolations) in ${languageName}. Keep the four dimension names exactly as listed below (they are scoring keys). Keep f-numbers, shutter speeds, and technical settings untranslated.

Grade across exactly these four rubric dimensions (each 0-10):
- "Composition": framing, balance, leading lines, use of the rule of thirds / negative space, subject placement.
- "Exposure & Technical": correct exposure, focus, depth of field, sharpness, noise.
- "Constraint Adherence": how well the photo meets the task's objective, compositional rule, focal length, aperture, and motion constraints. Use the supplied EXIF to verify settings; list concrete constraintViolations when a constraint is missed (e.g. "Shot at f/8 but the task asked for a wide aperture").
- "Creativity": originality, mood, storytelling.

Provide an overallScore (0-100), a one-paragraph summary, strengths, improvements, and any constraintViolations. Be specific and honest. Return ONLY the JSON object matching the provided schema.`;
